## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

A basic installation of Python >= 3.6 is required. Besides the standard conda distribution, the `tsdst` package is required. See [here](https://tomwerner5.github.io/tsdst/) for installation instructions.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

When I was a student at university, I often used RateMyProfessors.com to select a professor. Sometimes I was able to enroll in the coveted professor's class, and other times I was not. Having gone through this process myself, I was curious about what the genereal trends were relating to a professors quality, and if the qualities that make up a good professor could be inferred. I also wanted to know what kind of biases existed in these ratings. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are only two files associated with this project, namely:

1. Rateprof.csv (the data file)
2. rmp_analysis.ipynb (A Python Jupyter Notebook)

The full analysis can be executed from the notebook.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The results can viewed in detail from the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository, or in summary form in the medium article linked [here:]().

## Licensing and Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The data was sourced from the University of Minnesota, which can be found [here:](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~sandy/alr4ed/data/Rateprof.csv), and so I thank them for making the data available and free. This is built under the MIT License.
